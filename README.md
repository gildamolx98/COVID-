# COVID 19 - DATA ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS

## INTRODUCTION

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, providing valuable insights into the pandemic's spread, impact, and trends.

## KEY INSIGHTS

Firstly cards were made to analyse the total count of covid tests, active cases, recovered and deaths.![WhatsApp Image 2024-08-23 at 11 18 18 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69305e7e-776e-4bc5-a9fd-bd96c39c46f3)

Also showed the mortality rate(3.97%), recovered rate(34.3%),death rate in 100 conformed cases(4.86%), death rate in 100 recovered(22.1) and conformed case rate in total population (0.3129%) were found by using measure function and visualised by cards.![WhatsApp Image 2024-08-23 at 11 49 55 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7518d7-a562-43b9-a964-b504b2157b18)
A bar chart is generated to visualise the sum of death of covid 19 cases conformed across WHO region. ![Screenshot (201)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f398a7d0-9986-45d3-a25c-c4a4c7316823)
Here 9M American in WHO region were conformed covid.In western pacific region, less than a million were conformed.

Scatter plot for test Vs cases in 1M population is generated. in 1M tests, 10K were covid +ve.

A world map is showed here to analyse the spreadness of corona cases. Country USA had the top most covid cases.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92436699-5449-4374-9f14-fc3bee1de1e4)
A Donut  chart is generated to study the distribution of cases, recovers and death. 59.14 % of peoples were covid +ve, 38.84 % were recovered and unfortunately 2.02% were dead.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f47cb2a-87ab-4e3d-ac5f-b3ae1445e10f)
To study the trend of new cases, new recovered and new deaths,I had generated line graph. After 20K peoples were newly covid +ve, the sum of 35K were newly recovered and the sum of 500+ were dead. The sum of 50K were newly covid +ve, the sum of newly recovered is decreased and sum of newly dead is increased .![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf8f5583-e8b9-4456-8853-e69496b82a2d)
A table were created by using columns country, population, total tests, total cases, total recovered and total deaths.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/567b2ace-29b7-4ed3-863f-2307d4c4dd12)
I added 2 bookmarks, one for WHO region america and another for country India.![Screenshot (210)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a0e1dd5-ad6a-4b74-99fd-66b7eff8fa95)

A chart is added to compare recovered, death , conformed and active during that period of month.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92bc36b2-62d5-4c0e-bd80-5756a5cf7c78)

As showed below, an area graph is made to compare count of deaths and count of critical patients across continent. In every continent, death count is greater than critical patients count other than south america(counts were equal)![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72fa26e6-7e3e-4e9e-9ac2-c035f7a3ac0f)

## CONCLUSION

This analysis provides actionable insights for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and individuals to navigate the ongoing pandemic. By understanding these trends and patterns, we can better mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and work towards a healthier future.
